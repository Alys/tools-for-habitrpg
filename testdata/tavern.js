I joined HabitRPG after reading about it in an article about gamification. Back then I weight 120kg/265lbs. I started cooking healthy meals for myself instead of ordering or eating fast food, I started to drink at least 1L of water per day (and also kept the coffee down).\n\nAbout two months later I stopped using HabitRPG due to certain circumstances in my life, but I kept the good habits - drinking water, cooking for myself. I also started working out this january.  Earlier this month I came back to habitrpg because it is a fun way to keep track of my todos and dailies. It feels good, especially the feeling to tick of the last daily at the end of the day.\n  \nBut then you see that you're almost at the next level - so maybe do one more to-do for that level?  Sounds not too bad, doesn't it?\n\nNow I'm sitting here, weighting 80kg/176lbs, having a steady workout schedule and am doing edx courses additional to my universities' courses instead of slacking of.\n\nAnd all that started with HabitRPG one year ago.
